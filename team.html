           <div class="jobtitle">Cofounder, CEO</div>
           <p>Benjamin Lowenstein is the founder & CEO of Colingo, during which period he has raised more than $2.4M in venture capital to drive development of a more intuitive form of English-language-learning. He believes passionately that the status quo of the industry does not serve the synapses of the brain nor the social needs of an increasingly global and connected world. Prior to Colingo, he founded and run a boutique software development firm.</p>
           <p>He believes in working with his hands to realize the change we wish to see in the world, and is a self-taught software developer specializing in Javascript and Android development. When not behind a keyboard, he can often be found cooking, renovating his apartment, or riding a beater bicycle through the streets of San Francisco.</p>
